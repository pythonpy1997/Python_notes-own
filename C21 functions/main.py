#function = a block of code which is executed only when it is called

# def greet():
#     print("Hello!")
#     print("Good Morning")

# this is called function definition
# greet() is function name 
# we are using ":" because we need to give multiple statement inside function

 # now this function is ready and it will only work when we are Explicitly 

# greet() 
# This is called calling , if you dont call , it will not execute the function  

#output : 
# Hello!
# Good Morning

# Now i want to call two number , simplest example....

def add(x,y):
    c=x+y
    print(c)


add(5,4)

# x and y here is parameter , normally we call them argument 

# what value we are passing from "add(5,4)" , you have to accept it some where right ,
#          in x we have 5 and in y we have 4
