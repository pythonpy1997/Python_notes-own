#index operator [] = give access to a sequence's element (str,list,tuple)

name="tamal Mondal!"

# if (name[0].islower):
#     name=name.capitalize()

# print(name)    

# i would like to create a substring from the first part of the name variable , for that

#first_name=name[0:5].upper()

#first_name=name[:5].upper()
#we can leave start if we want to start from begaining because default value of starting index is 0

#last_name=name[6:].lower() # if we leave stopping index empty then by default it will go to last of the str

# print(first_name)
# print(last_name)


# You can sccess the last element in a sequence by using negative indexing so lets add a exxlamation (!) point to the end of our name....

# last_character=name[-2]

# print(last_character)

#output: l 
# so negative 2 is the second to last element in a sequence
