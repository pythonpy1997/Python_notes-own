#tuple = collection which is ordred and unchangeable #         used to group together related data

#   tuple is very similar to list but they are ordered and unchangeable.

# student=("Tom",21,"male")

#print(student.count("Tom")) # so it will count how many times value of Tom appears

#output: 1 
# so Tom appears one time within this tuple.


# print(student.index("male")) # it will display index of male 
#output: 2

#--------- You can display all of the contents within a tuple using a for loop----------#

# for x in student:
#     print(x)
    
#output:
#Tom
#21
#male     


#--------- if a certain value exists within our tuple using an if statement----------#

# if "Tom" in student:
#     print("Tom is here")

# since Tom is within here if statement will be true
# and this will print our statement of Tom is here.
