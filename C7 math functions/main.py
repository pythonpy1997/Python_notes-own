import math #math is a module

pi=3.14

pii=-3.14

print(round(pi)) #its a inbuild function and it will round the nearing whole int , like exp. pi=3.14 but now it will become 3

print(math.ceil(pi)) #it will round the number up to the nearest whole int , so pi rounded up is 4

print(math.floor(pi)) #it will round the number down to nearest whole int , so it will become 3


print(abs(pii)) #abs stands for "absolute value" function.it will how far a number from zero.so if you pass a negative number it will give you a positive number.

print(pow(pi,2)) #here pi is base and 2 is exponent , so pi power 2 = 9.8596

print(math.sqrt(144)) #this is located in the math module and this function use to get square root of any number (not negative value ofc).

#Now we have max function , max function will find the largest of a varying amount of values.

x=10
y=20
z=30

print(max(x,y,z)) # max function comparing x,y,z variable and giving largest of them as output.

print(min(x,y,z)) # min function compare x,y,z and giving smallest of them as output.
